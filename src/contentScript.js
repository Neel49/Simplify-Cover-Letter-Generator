  // 4) Construct the prompt
  const prompt = `
 
Write a creative, passionate, and human cover letter for the below job description. Below that is my resume. The cover letter should meet the following requirements:

Hook/Opening Paragraph:
Start with an outlandish, attention-grabbing hook that shows your excitement about transforming B2B billing through innovative technology. Make it imaginative and original‚Äîdo not copy phrases from the job posting. (For inspiration, see the Waabi cover letter example provided below.)

Research Achievement:
Include a highlighted section about one of your proudest achievements: lead-authoring a research paper published at ICMLA 2024.

Format the URL correctly as: (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13750) ‚Äîa
Boldly highlight this achievement (for example, by using markdown bold formatting).
Waterloo Works Job Navigator Experience:
Replace any previous experience references (like SideFX) with details about your "Waterloo Works Job Navigator" project. Include the following:

Mention that it is a Chrome extension that enhances Waterloo Works job browsing with features such as a modal-based job viewer, keyboard shortcuts (WASD + Q), and customizable layouts.
Include the GitHub link: https://github.com/Neel49/WaterlooWorks-Navigator
Boldly highlight that the extension attracted 50+ users in a single day.
You may briefly include a summary from the README if relevant (overview, key features, etc.).
Technical Skills and Passion:
Describe your strong proficiency in JavaScript, React.js, RESTful APIs, and modern web development practices. Show your excitement about writing clean, efficient code and learning new technologies. Let your passion for transforming everyday processes shine through.

Closing Paragraph:
Reiterate your enthusiasm for joining Globys and your eagerness to help streamline B2B billing processes. End with a confident, friendly sign-off.


Example for Style Reference (Do Not Copy Directly):

Dear Waabi Team,

The future of autonomy won‚Äôt be built by brute-force engineering‚Äîit will be AI-first, scalable, and fundamentally different from what‚Äôs come before. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm beyond excited about the opportunity to join Waabi as a Research Intern and contribute to shaping the next generation of self-driving technology.

One of my proudest achievements is lead-authoring a research paper, published at ICMLA 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13750) ‚Äîa‚Äîa milestone few undergraduates can claim. The research focused on self-supervised vision transformers for medical imaging, analyzing 100K+ chest X-rays to improve disease classification. Working with massive datasets and optimizing AI models to extract real-world insights reinforced my passion for pushing the boundaries of AI-driven perception, prediction, and control.

[The letter continues with details about technical skills and personal drive...]

Best,
