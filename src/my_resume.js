SideFX Toronto, ON 3D Software Developer Intern Sep. 2024 ‚Äì Dec. 2024 
‚Ä¢ Reduced data generation costs by 38% for the Houdini Deformer (an ML-based animation pipeline) by switching to a sparse neural network with localized principal component analysis, trimming model parameters by 26% without sacrificing accuracy. 
‚Ä¢ Decreased training time by 14% by designing a modified loss function that enabled precomputation of key terms with C++. 
‚Ä¢ With C++, I redesigned the ML pipeline to replace 50K+ vertex predictions with 256-dimensional vectors, reducing model size. 
National Research Council Canada Waterloo, ON Machine Learning Intern Jan. 2024 ‚Äì Apr. 2024 
‚Ä¢ Lead author on a published ICMLA '24 paper [1]: Architected a classification model for respiratory diseases in chest X-rays using knowledge distillation with PyTorch Vision Transformers, achieving 98% recall using 100K training images from the NIH. 
‚Ä¢ Deployed a data pipeline on Google Cloud Run for 30k images, performing image segmentation & normalization with a U-net. 
‚Ä¢ Migrated to Google Compute Engine for model training with COVIDx dataset (80K+ images), accelerating training by 1.3x. 
Neurocage Systems Lethbridge, AB Engineering Design Intern May 2023 ‚Äì Aug. 2023 
‚Ä¢ Accelerated PyTorch model inference from 6 to 10 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi using model quantization and ARM Compute Library optimizations with ONNX Runtime. 
‚Ä¢ Implemented Grad-CAM on an R-CNN model to generate heatmaps, corrected 500 noisy images, increasing F1-score by 5%. 
‚Ä¢ Automated brain slice image reorientation using Python and OpenCV contours, reducing manual processing time by 40%. 
Sawback Technologies Calgary, AB Hardware Design Intern Jun. 2022 ‚Äì Aug 2022 
‚Ä¢ Helped design and assemble an autonomous drone for ground penetrating radar mapping to detect subsurface features. 
‚Ä¢ Reduced autonomous drone travel time by 6% by using the A* algorithm in DroneKit through the MAVLink protocol.
