It is not science fiction; it is right here on earth with Intrinsic's groundbreaking approach. Reimagining what's possible with AI in robotics is not just about automated production; it's about redefining potential and I want to be a part of that journey.\n\nDuring my internship at SideFX, I learned that innovation sometimes means trimming the excess. By adapting a sparse neural network with localized principal component analysis, I reduced data generation costs by 38% and streamlined the ML pipeline. These tweaks are not just lines of code‚Äîthey embody a philosophy of efficiency that I'm eager to bring to Intrinsic as we explore the frontier of 3D reconstruction.\n\nMy experience at the National Research Council shaped me as a diligent researcher eager to turn ideas into action. I had the rare chance to lead the authorship of a paper that was published at ICMLA 2024‚Äîa milestone few undergraduates reach. By architecting a classification model for respiratory diseases using knowledge distillation, I pushed the boundaries of medical imaging, a mindset that aligns symbiotically with Intrinsic's mission of advancing state-of-the-art techniques.\n\nLate-night coding sessions fueled by the buzz of potential and a pretty strong cup of coffee are what push boundary-breaking innovation. I thrive on that nocturnal grind, whether it's weighing a loss function variable or learning more about NeRFs' capabilities in revolutionizing 3D vision. I'm energized by the thought of contributing my relentless curiosity to your mission, hopefully with a fridge stocked with cold brew to fuel the journey.\n\nLooking forward to diving into the world of intelligent robotics with you!\n\nWarmly,\nNeel Patel"

The idea of working on software that can control industrial vehicles\u2014tractors, mining trucks, and port machinery\u2014feels like stepping into the autonomous revolution at ground zero, and I\u2019d love to be part of that journey.\n\nOne of my proudest achievements is lead-authoring my first research paper, which was accepted at ICMLA 2024\u2014a milestone not many undergraduates can claim. The paper focused on applying self-supervised vision transformers for disease detection in medical imaging, working with 100K+ images. My contributions included multi-label classification, pushing recall from 95% to 98%, and refining knowledge distillation techniques for better model generalization. I bring that same problem-solving mindset to robotics, where autonomy demands similar rigor in perception, controls, and safety.\n\nAt SideFX, I worked on sparse neural networks to improve animation pipelines, a project that sharpened my ability to optimize models for real-world constraints\u2014whether in graphics or autonomous systems. I\n\nGot it\u2014you want something human, original, and engaging while still showcasing your technical expertise and past achievements. Here's your refined cover letter for Polymath Robotics:\n\nDear Polymath Robotics Team,\nAutonomous vehicles, especially in industrial settings, are where robotics gets real\u2014no lab-perfect conditions, just raw, unpredictable environments. That\u2019s what excites me about Polymath. You\u2019re not chasing sci-fi concepts; you\u2019re making autonomy actually usable in the field, and I want to be part of that.\n\nOne of my proudest achievements is lead-authoring my first research paper, accepted at ICMLA 2024\u2014a milestone not many undergraduates can claim. I worked on self-supervised vision transformers for medical imaging, tackling 100K+ datasets to classify diseases like tuberculosis and COVID-19. The multi-label classification method I developed improved recall from 95% to 98%, and I see a parallel between this and the challenges in robotics: designing robust systems that can generalize to messy, real-world inputs.\n\nAt SideFX, I worked on sparse neural networks for animation pipelines, optimizing inference while keeping high fidelity. It taught me how to make AI efficient, which is just as critical when deploying robotics in resource-constrained environments. But more than the tech itself, I love the process\u2014figuring things out, iterating fast, and pushing systems to their limits. That\u2019s why I\u2019d thrive at Polymath.\n\nBeyond the technical side, I love the idea of working on a tight-knit, fast-moving team where engineers own projects end-to-end. I\u2019m the kind of person who\u2019ll stay up late debugging a controls issue, not because I have to, but because I need to know why it\u2019s broken. And if Polymath has a fridge stocked with cold brew, even better.\n\nI\u2019d love to chat about how my experience in machine vision, AI, and real-time systems could contribute to Polymath\u2019s mission. Looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nThis keeps it authentic, confident, and to the point, while highlighting your unique experience without just rewording their job post.

Our courses teach you what you need to know, while skipping the stuff you don't - so expect more about solving equations, statistical analysis, logical deduction, neural networks, and generative AI, and less about abstract theorems and integrating complicated trig functions.\n\nWe serve hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers, and we're hoping you might be the right person to contribute to accelerating our footprint to millions of customers (and changed lives). In addition to what's below, you can learn more about our team culture on our careers page: https://brilliant.org/careers/\n\nWe have always prioritized building a healthy business as the backbone of achieving our mission. We are default alive (will be profitable before needing to raise) and are growing new customers at an exciting pace (high double-digits year-over-year). Our investors are top-tier + mission aligned, and we've kept our valuations tethered to reality - we aren't playing \"catch up\" like many others.\n\nIn our day-to-day, we value adventure, excellence, generosity, and candor. We are optimists in the face of uncertainty, we take pride in our work, we go the extra mile for each other, and we tell it like it is (the good and the bad). We're all here to do the best work of our lives together, and have a lot of fun along the way.\n\n\nThe Role\n\nEngineers at Brilliant work closely with members of our Product, Design, and Content teams in cross-disciplinary pods to solve important problems for our learners. We're looking for autonomous, high-agency, and high-growth-trajectory individuals to join our team and drive significant features across our product.\n\nYou'll work on our Growth pod (helping more people commit to learning something new via Brilliant's logged out experience, new user experience, and payments infrastructure) or User Motivation pod (making learning on Brilliant more motivating, engaging, and rewarding through various different game mechanics like league leaderboards, streaks, and experience points).\n\nInteractive education is in its infancy: we've only scratched the surface of what's possible with computer-based pedagogy.

You avoid introducing complex, novel, or \"clever\" solutions. You write code for humans, not for computers.\nYou're excited to collaborate closely with talented engineers, product managers, and designers. You enjoy solving problems as a team, pair-programming, and sharing knowledge. You want to be a mentor and to be mentored.\nYou have deep experience with a few languages and frameworks, and you know what you do and do not like about them. You believe in using the right tool for the job - even when it's an unfamiliar one, and especially when it's a boring one. You stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and patterns, recognizing the differences between a game-changer and a passing fad.\nLack of prior experience with a specific technology is never disqualifying, but experience with React, NextJS, Python, Django, Kotlin, or Swift would help you hit the ground running.\nYou have a favorite product and can articulate your perspective on what makes using it delightful. You often think about how the products you use could be better.\nCompensation and Benefits:\tCompensation and Benefits\n\nWe use a systematic compensation framework: salary scales are set each year for each job vertical, managers level folks on their team, and those levels are mapped directly to our compensation scales. A location-based adjustment is applied outside of SF and NYC (typically 5-10%).\n\nGiven the systematic approach, we always make First and Best offers - there is no negotiation (for new hires nor our existing teammates). This ensures people are paid based on their expected contribution, not their negotiation skills.\n\nWe offer flexible PTO and also provide free food at our offices.\n\nThe likely rate for this role depending on leveling would be $60.10 to $74.52 USD per hour.\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\t\nTargeted Clusters\n- Theme - Computing: Software Development\n\nSomething similar for Brilliant for the Software Engineering Position. \n\n3/3"

I\u2019ve also worked extensively with Python, C++, deep learning frameworks, and probabilistic modeling, and I\u2019m eager to apply these skills to Waabi\u2019s research in motion planning, AV perception, and reinforcement learning. Whether it\u2019s fine-tuning deep models, optimizing simulation environments, or developing novel control algorithms, I\u2019m ready to contribute at every level.\n\nBeyond technical skills, I thrive in high-ownership, research-driven environments where the challenge isn\u2019t just to make AI work\u2014but to make it work in the real world. Working with Raquel Urtasun and Waabi\u2019s research team\u2014where deep learning meets robotics at scale\u2014is exactly the kind of environment I want to be in. The problems you\u2019re solving aren\u2019t just theoretical; they\u2019re what will define the future of self-driving, and I\u2019d love the chance to be part of it.\n\nI\u2019m the kind of person who\u2019ll stay up at 2 a.m. tweaking a model, not because I have to, but because I need to know if it can be better. And if the Waabi office has an espresso machine, even better.\n\nI\u2019d love the opportunity to bring my AI, machine learning, and robotics experience to Waabi. Looking forward to the conversation!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"
